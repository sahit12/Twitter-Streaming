# Twitter-Streaming
Created a twitter streaming python file and storing the data into MongoDB

The data is streamed based on the input given in the python list and it streams the data based on that. The data that is relevant is collected through the streaming API and is extracted. Finally it is stored in mongoDB.

Note : The error shown in .ipynb file was because of Interrupting the streaming data through keyboard.
